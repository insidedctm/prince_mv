# Code and Problem Solutions for 'Computer Vision' by Simon Prince
Simon Prince has written a wonderful book ([Computer Vision](http://www.computervisionmodels.com/)) on computer vision algorithms and techniques with a particular focus on Probabilistic and Machine Learning approaches. This repository contains solutions to problems from the book and code for implementation of some of the algorithms.
